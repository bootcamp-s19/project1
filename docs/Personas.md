### Personas

* Eager Ernie: Eager voting-age teens through late twenty somethings that are obviously interested in politics and what candidates can do for society, but are not so well informed on the issues.

* Vapid Velma: Voters who don't closely follow politics and current affairs, but could be easily swayed into voting.

* Outgoing Oliver: Loves keeping up with the latest and greatest, especially in the political realm. Loves Samwise's type of ideas and would definitely vote for him.

* Hater Heather: Like Oliver, loves politics and keeping afoot of current headlines, but is against what Samwise would stand for.

### Stories

* Eager Ernie: Needs an aesthetically pleasing website that is easily navigable in order to get to different parts of the site, so that the learning process is made more efficient.

* Vapid Velma: Needs a website that is in her face; bold and forceful that will excite her into to vote for the candidate.

* Outgoing Oliver: Needs a basic site; Oliver is already pretty aware of the candidate and what he is about so a quick way to navigate to the vote is the most important.

* Hater Heather: Needs a persuasive site that is makes great arguments for the pros of voting for our candidate, arguments that overshadow her leanings towards the other sides promises.
