### Personas

* Eager Ernie: Eager voting-age teens through late twenty somethings that are obviously interested in politics and what candidates can do for society, but are not so well informed on the issues.

* Vapid Velma: Voters who don't closely follow politics and current affairs, but could be easily swayed into voting.

* Outgoing Oliver: Loves keeping up with the latest and greatest, especially in the political realm. Loves Samwise's type of ideas and would definitely vote for him.

* Hater Heather: Like Oliver, loves politics and keeping afoot of current headlines, but hates what Samwise would stand for.
