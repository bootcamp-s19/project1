### Personas

* Eager Ernie: Eager voting-age teens through late twenty somethings that are obviously interested in politics and what candidates can do for society, but are not so well informed on the issues.

* Vapid Velma: Voters who don't closely follow politics and current affairs, but could be easily swayed into voting.

* Outgoing Oliver: Loves keeping up with the latest and greatest, especially in the political realm. Loves Samwise's type of ideas and would definitely vote for him.

* Hater Heather: Like Oliver, loves politics and keeping afoot of current headlines, but is against what Samwise would stand for.

### Stories

* Eager Ernie: Needs an aesthetically pleasing website that is easily navigable, so that the learning process is made more efficient.
    * Unlike a basic markdown file, with a navigation bar or a navigation menu, in order to access all available information present.
        - As an Eager Ernie I want to visit and browse the candidate's website in order to gather more information about the issues to be more well informed.

* Vapid Velma: Needs a website that is in her face; bold and forceful that will excite her into impulsively voting for the candidate.
    * Hero element that immediately induces excitement, bold button leading to vote.
        - As a Vapid Velma I want to visit the candidates site to be quickly lead/drawn to the candidate in order to make a quick voting decision without doubts.

* Outgoing Oliver: Needs a basic site; Oliver is already pretty aware of the candidate and what he is about so a quick way to navigate to the vote is the most important.
    * Simplistic and obvious navigation, obvious and quick way to reach the vote with a bold button.
        - As an Outgoing Oliver I want to quickly skim over the candidates website without diving in too deep in order to reach the voting process since my decision is made.

* Hater Heather: Needs a persuasive site that makes great arguments for the pros of voting for our candidate, arguments that overshadow her leanings towards the other sides promises.
    * Visually pleasing unlike basic markdown file to make good first impression and hold interest, with bold button challenging them to delve further.
        - As a Hater Heather I want to see proof of the candidates good deeds that will change my biased/opposing opinions in order to be moved to vote for this candidate.
